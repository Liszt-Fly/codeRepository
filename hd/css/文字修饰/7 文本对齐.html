			Are you a designer or a business owner looking to kickstart your delivery
			service? These design assets are ideal for a food delivery app for a
			restaurant or grocery store. If that sounds like you, then Figma food
			delivery app UI could be just the thing. This is a very high quality free
			resource, with sleek design and a user-friendly interface (why canâ€™t all
			delivery apps be this user-friendly?!). This is a very timely free UI
			resource for many businesses out there, so a big thanks to the team over
			at Chili Labs for this excellent contribution
