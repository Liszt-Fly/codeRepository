			Speech recognition involves receiving speech through a device's
			microphone, which is then checked by a speech recognition service against
			a list of grammar (basically, the vocabulary you want to have recognized
			in a particular app.) When a word or phrase is successfully recognized, it
			is returned as a result (or list of results) as a text string, and further
			actions can be initiated as a result. The Web Speech API has a main
			controller interface for this — SpeechRecognition — plus a number of
			closely-related interfaces for representing grammar, results, etc.
			Generally, the default speech recognition system available on the device
			will be used for the speech recognition — most modern OSes have a speech
			recognition system for issuing voice commands. Think about Dictation on
			macOS, Siri on iOS, Cortana on Windows 10, Android Speech, etc.
